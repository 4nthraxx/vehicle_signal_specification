# RELEASE PROCESS
This document describes the process for creating a new version of the
signal specification.

The process, driven by the GENIVI Remote Vehicle Interaction Expert
Group (RVI EG), is aimed at being lightweight and carried out in public, giving both
GENIVI members and non-members a say in the creation of a new version.

In git, the ```develop``` branch is used as an integration branch
accepting pull requests with new and modified vpsec files from
contributors.

Pull requests are reviewed in the public genivi 
list ```genivi-projects@lists.genivi.org```. Once the review process
has concluded, the RVI EG decides if the pull request is to be
accepted or not.

A new signal specification release is created by an RVI weekly meeting decision
where at least 50% of the present vote for a new release.

Each release is incrementally numbered, starting with 1.

A release is tagged in git with the tag

    ver_[n]

where [n] is the release number.
