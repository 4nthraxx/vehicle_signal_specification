# VEHICLE SIGNAL SPECIFICATION
This repository specifies a set of vehicle signals that can be used in
automotive applications to communicate the state of various vehicle
systems.

The collection of signal specifications, or simply signals, are vendor
independent. Vendor-specific extensions can be specified in a dediceated and
uncontrolled branch of the signal specification tree. 


The format of the directories and signal specification files is aimed
at allowing easy, git-based management with branching, merging, and
release.

A released signal specification can be used, together with tools in
this repository, to automatically generate a number of different
target specification formats, such as JSON, FrancaIDL, etc.
